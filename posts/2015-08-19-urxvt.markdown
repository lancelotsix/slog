Since some time, I moved away from the “traditional” linux desktop
environments such as [Gnome](http://gnome.org/),
[Kde](https://www.kde.org/) or [Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/).
Not that those usual desktop environments are bad, or hard to use
(far from that), just that at some point they just have to much for me.
To much of functionality I do not use.

To accommodate my way of working, I ended up using tiling window managers
such as [i3](http://i3wm.org/) to finally [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)
(associated with [taffybar](https://github.com/travitch/taffybar)).
Those tools are just perfect. Minimalistic and awesome (I mean the adjective,
but this appends to also name another tiling window manager). The only problem
I still had was: what terminal emulator should I use? I have been using
interchangeably `xfce4-terminal`, `konsole` and `gnome-terminal`. However,
they tend to bring with them the entire set of libraries designed to support
entire desktop environments. I do not really need those just to run `vim`
within my terminal emulator…

After some time, I finally gave a shot to
[`rxvt-unicode`](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) (also known
as `urxvt`). Unlike the previous terminal emulators I mentioned, the default
look and feel is kind of “wurch”, and there is no menu to configure it. Like
the “good old days”, a regular configuration file does the trick, here I present
to you `~/.Xresources`. It is a general configuration for X related application
look and feel. It controls fonts, colors, shapes of graphical elements… A
presentation.

Here is my configuration to get a [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
presentation (borrowed from [here](https://github.com/solarized/xresources)):

As you can see, I also use fonts tailored for
[powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline). They can be found
[here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts), then just follow installation
instructions. Last interesting point of `urxvt`, it us a full 256 colors
terminal emulator! Welcome in 2015, but the fact is that the other terminal
emulators I mentioned earlier only do 16, and get a pretty limited output when
using powerline.

One annoying thing about thing with this “old-style” terminal emulator is that
it is not well supported by remote servers when connecting through `ssh`.
Additional terminfo descriptions might have to be installed (copy the files
`rxvt-unicode` and `rxvt-unicode-256color` in `/usr/share/terminfo/r/` or
`~/.terminfo/r/`).

More usefull information can be found at
[ArchLinux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rxvt-unicode), they got
detailed explanations.

Here it is for tonight, this was my bookmark post!
